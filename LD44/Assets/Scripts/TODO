fix bad movement
animate sprite mask
camera follow
bug: arrow: NullPointerException when spawned arrow kills enemy before m_collider is disabled
Find a way player can be killed / add enemies
bug: Probably all zombies will spawn at the exact same spot one on top of the other
IDEA: dead zombie's rotation = ! current zombie's rotation
make space == jump

[POLISH]: Camera fading and all that
Decide if player can stand and do stuff on arrows or not.
bug: player death: multiple zombies: Make sure only dies once
bug: Player on zombie's head bugs
bug: jumping on zombie's head twice makes me die
